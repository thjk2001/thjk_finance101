    "text": "Greetings! My name is Jack Kim, a senior at Pomona College studying Economics and Math. An aspiring value investor, I believe in developing independent analysis and testing them with simplified models. This is an ongoing process. In my limited experience in finance and investing, I have had the privilege of meeting distinguished individuals who have all inspired me to embark on this challenge myself. To complement my limited professional experience, I have become an avid reader and a student of history. I say this with humility, but I believe this space could mark the start of a long-term journey toward launching my own fund.\nRecently, I have come to the understanding that sports is an inseparable part of who I am. While I have been a lifelong athlete, I have realized that my true passion lies in studying sports, more so than taking a part in them. This acknowledgement has motivated me to pursue some interesting side gigs - European football analysis and Sabermetrics. This is a chance to flex my background in econometrics to drive real-time sports innovation."
